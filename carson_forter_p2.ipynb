    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "a) KNN doesn't work as well here, because our data is high-dimensional (~27k) and KNN is capturing all that variance and likely overfitting. This idea seems confirmed by the fact that the grid search returns a high value of K (K=100) as the best performing.  \n",
    "b) I actually would have expected logistic regression to outperform NB, because of NB's independence assumption and the fact that the likelihood of one word's appearance depends on another. But since is the not the case, I'd guess that NB's high bias is advantage here and that the logistic regression model is overfitting somewhat.\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001)."

    "TFIDF is different because it not only counts how frequently a word appears in an observation, but also how frequently it appears in all of the data. It then weights the importance of each word by the inverse of it's total frequencey, so a word that appears more frequently across all the data is less important than one that is rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like the mistakes are being made on very large and very small examples, i.e. those with lots of words or very few words. The problem with the long observations might be that a long post is more likely to have rare words (and more of them) due soley to it's length, and so the model is overconfident in its prediction. Maybe taking a sample/subset of the long posts, or even just truncating them, would help to prevent this."
